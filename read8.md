# layout
elements are often used as containing elements to group together sections of a page. Browsers display pages in normal flow unless you specify
1. relative
2. absolute
3. fixed

> Normal flow will appears every block element on a new line, Relative position allows you to shift elements to (Top, Bottom, Right, Left) and this does not affect the position of surrounding elements
>Layout Grids Composition in any visual art (such as design, painting, or photography) is the placement or arrangement of visual elements â€” how they are organized on a page. Many designers use a grid structure to help them position items on a page, and the same is true for web designers.
 # Floating Elements 
The float property allows you to take an element in normal flow and place it as far to the left or right of the containing element as possible. Anything else that sits inside the containing element will flow around the element that is floated.
# Screen Sizes
Different visitors to your site will have different sized screens that show different amounts of information, so your design needs to be able to work on a range of different sized screens
