# JS Object Literals

its a  is a series of variables and functions that represent something from the world around you
### JavaScript also has several built-in objects such as
1. String
2. Number
3. Math
4. Date
### dom tree
the dom tree is a model web page As a browser loads a web page, it creates a model of that page.
The model is called a DOM tree, and it is stored in the browsers' memory. It consists of four main types of nodes.

1. THE DOCUMENT NODE
2. ELEMENT NODES
3. ATTRIBUTE NODES
4. TEXT NODES

In a static Nodelist when your script updates the page, the NodeList is not updated to reflect the changes made by the script.
You can use loops within Nodelist.
When you have an element node, you can select another element in relation to it using these five properties:
parentNode
previousSibling
nextSibling
firstChild
lastChild
When you select a text node, you can retrieve or amend the content of it using the nodeVa1ue property.
The textContent property allows you to collect or update just the text that is in the containing element (and its children).
The innerHTML property: you can access and amend the contents of an element, including any child elements.
Approach.
Adding Content.
Removing Content.
ADVANTAGES • You can use it to add a lot of new markup using less code than DOM manipulation methods. • It can be faster than DOM manipulation when adding a lot of new elements to a web page. • It is a simple way to remove all of the content from one element (by assigning it a blank string).
DISADVANTAGES • It should not be used to add content that has come from a user (such as a username or blog comment), as it can pose a significant security risk which is discussed over the next four pages. • It can be difficult to isolate single elements that you want to update within a larger DOM fragment. • Event handlers may no longer work as intended.
DOM manipulation offers another technique to add new content to a page:
createElement ().
createTextNode().
appendChild().
The document object’s write () method is a simple way to add content that was not in the original source code to the page, but its use is rarely advised.
ADVANTAGES • It is a quick and easy way to show beginners how content can be added to a page.
DISADVANTAGES • It only works when the page initially loads. • If you use it after the page has loaded it can:
Overwrite the whole page
Not add the content to the page
Create a new page • It can cause problems with XHTML pages that are strictly validated. • This method is very rarely used by programmers these days and is generally frowned upon.
VALIDATE INPUT GOING TO THE SERVER:
Only let visitors input the kind of characters they need to when supplying information.
Double-check validation on the server before displaying user content/storing it in a database.
The database may safely contain markup and script from trusted sources.
As your data leaves the database, all potentially dangerous characters should be escaped.
Make sure that you are only inserting content generated by users into certain parts of the template files.
Do not create DOM fragments containing HTML from untrusted sources.
